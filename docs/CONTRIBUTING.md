# Contributing to HMS IDM


## Getting Started

The repository is using [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

- Fork the repository in your namespace.
- Clone the repository locally.
- Create a branch.
- Add changes:
  - If you change the api, run `make generate-api`.
  - If you add a new view, update `./src/Routes.tsx` file, and
    add your view in a new directory `./src/Routes/MyNewView`, with
    the files `MyNewView.tsx`, `MyNewView.scss` and `MyNewView.test.tsx`.
  - If you add a new component, encapsulate in a new `./src/Components` (shared) or
    in the `Components` directory of the view that it belongs to.
- Check everything build: `make build`
- Check locally by using: `make run` and be sure the backend is started too.
- FIXME Depending on the frontend containerization
  Check it deploys and works in ephemeral by: `make ephemeral-deploy`
- Add unit tests. See [99-testing](./99-testing.md).
- Check unit tests and linters are pasing by `make lint test`
- Rebase and push your changes, and create a MR or PR.
- Update changes from the review until you get an ACK.
- Merge your changes :)

## Guidelines

### Commit messages

Follow the [conventional commits guidelines][conventional_commits] to *make
reviews easier* and to make the VCS/git logs more valuable. The general
structure of a commit message is:

```
<type>([optional scope]): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- Prefix the commit subject with one of these [_types_](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json):
    - `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`,
      `test`, `style`, `chore`.
    - You can **ignore this for "fixup" commits** or any commits you expect to be squashed.
- Append optional scope to _type_ such as `(page)`, `(comp)`, `(api)`, â€¦:
  - `(page)`: Scope the change to the input adapter components.
  - `(comp)`: Scope a component change `src/Components` or `src/Routes/*Page/Components`.
  - `(api)`: Scope an api change related with re-generation of the client.
- _Description_ shouldn't start with a capital letter or end in a period.
- Use the _imperative voice_: "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
- Try to keep the first line under 72 characters.
- A blank line must follow the subject.
- Breaking API changes must be indicated by
    1. "!" after the type/scope, and
    2. a "BREAKING CHANGE" footer describing the change.
       Example:
       ```
       refactor(provider)!: drop support for Python 2

       BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use Python 3 features since Python 2 is no longer supported.
       ```

### Automated builds (CI)

Each pull request must pass the automated builds.
